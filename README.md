# Master-DevOps

# Small Description
I deploy a GoLang and ReactJS basic application with a back-end and front-end service which uses containers for each and publish it to github.com repositry (You can use your own)
Then I create a docker-compose file where these containers can be served together.
Then I do container orchestration using docker-swarm and kubernetes
Make sure you create such cluster using Ansible Scripts / Terraform
Once it done i create a Jenkins machine and create a pipeline to do all the above steps automatically on every code push on master branch.
